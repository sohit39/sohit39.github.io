        <h3>Mission</h3>

        <p class="quote">
            " To provide an integrated, immersive, and, most importantly,  
            inclusive education for all disbaled children "
        </p>

        <p>
            By promoting the disabled childrens' self-confidence through
            education, the school primarily aims to motivate students and show
            them disability is hardly a disadvantage. MVSS provides education from 
            I through X (1st to 10th Grade). Moreover, boarding, meals, 
            books, and schooling are all provided free of cost; the school 
            runs purely on donations. By and large, the school gives disabled 
            children from rural areas a normal, quality education as well as
            day-to-day sustenance. This idea that disability is ability is what
            makes this school so special, effective, and worth contributing to.

				<p>
					D. Sai is currently in 7th grade, and he arrived as an orphan at MVSS around two years ago. After losing both his parents,
					he was received warmly by the school. By taking him in and providing food, shelter, and education, MVSS is giving Sai a real

				<p> 
					C. Appala Raju recently started 8th grade, and it is his second year at MVSS. Unfortunately, he not only suffers from Polio, but 
					also lost a parent at an early age. The school, without hesitiating, took him in and provided him with basic necessities and education.
					He was provided with a wheelchair and receives necessary care--whether it be with daily activities or schoolwork.

        <h3>About the Founder</h3>

        <p>
            MVSS was founded by Mr.Potnuru Satya Tuirupathi Rao Patnaik
            more commonly known as just Mr.Patnaik. Born disabled, he had
            an arduous childhood, facing difficulty completing even Primary
            School due to the lack of facilities and welfare schemes. 
		</p>
		<p>
			These hardships are what spurred him to voice for the empowerement of 
            Persons With Disabilities (PWDs). He believes that illiteracy is
            the chief cause for the belittlement of the disabled in current
			society. In order to counteract this, MVSS and the school was
			founded in 1998. The school was called the "Integrated Vikalangula 
			Ashrama Patasala," (translation), it consists of classes I through X 
			(1st to 10th grade). It is now formally recognised by the Department 
			of Education (Govt. of AP). 	
		</p>

		<h4>Awards</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Many awards across the board from neighbourhood to national level
					for empowerement of fellow disbaled.
				</li>
				<li>
					In 2006, he received the best award in the national level; it was 
					presented to him by then president Shri APJ Abdul Kalam.
				</li>
				<li>More awards</li>
